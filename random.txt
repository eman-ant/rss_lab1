That my days have been a dream;
Them with a tighter clasp?
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Take this kiss upon the brow!
And I hold within my hand
While I weep--while I weep!

Is all that we see or seem
O God! can I not save
While I weep--while I weep!
That my days have been a dream;
And I hold within my hand
In a vision, or in none,
While I weep--while I weep!
While I weep--while I weep!
Grains of the golden sand--
