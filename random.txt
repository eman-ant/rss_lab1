I stand amid the roar
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Grains of the golden sand--
And I hold within my hand
And, in parting from you now,
And I hold within my hand
How few! yet how they creep
That my days have been a dream;
I stand amid the roar
How few! yet how they creep
That my days have been a dream;
O God! can I not save
Thus much let me avow--
