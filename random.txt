I stand amid the roar
And I hold within my hand
Is but a dream within a dream.
Is it therefore the less gone?
While I weep--while I weep!
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Grains of the golden sand--
You are not wrong, who deem
You are not wrong, who deem
And I hold within my hand
Is all that we see or seem
Them with a tighter clasp?
But a dream within a dream?Them with a tighter clasp?
Through my fingers to the deep,
One from the pitiless wave?
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
Take this kiss upon the brow!
One from the pitiless wave?
In a vision, or in none,
Of a surf-tormented shore,
